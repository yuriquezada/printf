.TH man 3 "23 Jul 2021" "Holberton School 0x11. C - _printf"

.SH NAME
_printf (): Take the input to make formatted prints.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

.SH Syntax
int _printf (const char * format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf () function takes one argument: a string of characters to print. 
This string is made up of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it appears. 
On the other hand, we have characters that normally print as expected, but when you add a specifier, they become special. 
The format specifiers are:
FORMAT generates a specific format relative to the input of the specifier.

.SH Return value
The _printf () function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to finalize the output to strings).

.B %c
Print a character passed as a parameter.

.B %s
Prints a string of characters terminated with a null.

.B %S
Prints a string of characters and the number in hexadecimal of a special character that is written like this '\ x' according to the ASCII table.

.B %%
Print a percentage sign.

.B %d
Prints a signed decimal number.

.B %i
Converts an argument to unsigned decimal notation and prints it.

.B %b
Converts the unsigned integer to binary and prints it.

.B %u
Prints an unsigned decimal number.

.B %o
Prints the octal unsigned integer conversion.

.B %x
Unsigned hex conversion to lowercase.

.B %X
Unsigned hex conversion to uppercase.

.B %p
Print a memory address (pointer).

.B %h
